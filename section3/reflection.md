## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I think it's an interesting concept that people's personalities and even their intelligence are subject to change.  It goes directly against the mainstream psychological dogma that we are basically formed as individuals around the age of 5 and the rest of our lives is spent trying to make the best of what we got.  Obviously I'd like to believe in the Growth Mindset, but there's more evidence that it's more of wishful thinking and that pulling oneself up by his/her bootstraps goes beyond the laws of physics.  I do believe though that whatever potential we got is hardly ever tapped and that hard work can always make us better no matter the limitations.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I'm definitely trying to grow as much as I can.  Not only am I trying to make a complete career change, I'm also diving into the subjects that I always thought I was bad at and so far I've been surprising myself with my actual abilities.  Maybe that's what the Growth Mindset actually is, not literally changing yourself, but changing your opinion about yourself which in turn allows you to be more than you ever thought you could be.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I would imagine that every application probably uses arrays to some degree because it's a really convenient way of storing data.  I think a good example of an array would be in a music app that uses playlists.  It would be really easy to add, remove, randomize and repeat songs if their file names were stored in an array.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is a built-in system for constructing and manipulating an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is a way of automating a task that involves repetition.  We'd use a loop with an array when we want to test different data points within the array for the same condition and execute code multiple times. We could use a loop without an array if we wanted to count something or to log it multiple times.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is like wind up mechanism in a clockwork toy.  We turn the winder to activate the toy, which makes the toy go through its motions as it unwinds.  The number of times we turn the winder will determine the number of moves the toy makes before the action stops.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I'd like to learn more about different types of loops and their use.
