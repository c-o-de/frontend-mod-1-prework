## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I love asking questions and I'm not afraid to do it.  Though I try to build a cache of at least a couple of questions that I haven't been able to find answers to and then ask them all at once when I have the attention of the person who's helping me.  I believe this way is probably less distracting to them, because personally I'd rather be disturbed once to quickly answer a couple of easy questions instead of being disturbed at least twice as often.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It was a bit uncomfortable, but since the questions weren't too far off of what we'd covered it wasn't too bad.  I definitely felt the need to use my imagination instead of going the easy route of "fill in the blanks."  I think it's a great exercise when the task at hand is within reason.  Definitely a fine balance between letting students think on their own and completely overwhelming them.  To me these exercises felt just right.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is a block of code that will execute only if a certain condition has been met.  A real life example would be "If it rains grab an umbrella."  I will only grab an umbrella if it rains.

A web application example would be "If a shopper clicks on "check out" and has at least $50 worth of goods in the shopping cart offer them free shipping, otherwise calculate shipping costs."

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You can assign multiple conditions using if/else statements.  The program reads the first condition and if it's false the program moves to the next line of code and so forth until it finds the first one that's true at which point it executes the command.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

You can use the comparison operators such as || and &&.  They allow you to make your code more complex.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

While working on the functions.js section I saw that the author has placed semicolons after the curly brackets even though in the video we were told not to do this.  Which way is the correct one?
