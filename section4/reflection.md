## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

It didn't really feel much different.  After giving the Pomodoro technique a go I decided that it wasn't for me.  I don't like
taking myself out of the zone when I'm working.  If I get tired I know when to take a break.  Otherwise I want to keep working on
the problem until it's solved.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

Since all the work I was doing was predetermined by the prework exercises I couldn't really notice the difference between writing down
my intentions and just looking at the task at hand and knowing what needs to be done.  Maybe it's more applicable when you're not exactly sure what needs to be done so you map out your work ahead of time.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

Object is an entity that consists of different qualities and characteristics.  An array is used for storing data in a single variable.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class / I would use an array because here you just need a list.

  * List of states and their capitals / This should be an object since there are going to be properties added to each item and possibly accessed separately at a later time.

  * List of things to pack for vacation / I think this could go either way.  If it's a simple list then it could be an array, but if it's a list where there may be multiples of the same item then I'd go with an object.

  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow / this can be a simple list stored in an array.

  * List of student names and their cohort / This could be either.  If we're just storing strings with name and cohort then this could be an array, but if we plan or making changes and manipulating data then it should be an object.

  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake / Here I would use an object, because here we have multiple properties that have their own arguments.

  * All my favorite restaurants / this is a list that can be stored in an array since it's just a few strings without properties.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

When I shop on Amazon it stores a lot of data on the items I have purchased or saved for later.  It could have keys like 'subscribeAndSave', 'kindleBooksOrdered', 'amazonPrimeExpirationDate'.  The values would contain things like names of books that I've ordered and dates, subscribe and save items' names, their reorder dates, how many times I've ordered those items.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

Would it be possible to add more content to the section 4 guide?  Every section so far has had links to videos, links to articles as well as page numbers for the textbook.  This section covers the most complex concepts we've seen so far and yet there are no additional resources that could help us understand them.
